                                Nancy Lee is a Filipino-Chinese
                                contemporary and mixed-media artist born
                                and raised in the Philippines. Inspired by her
                                grandfather, a Fine Arts professor and  
                                professional watercolorist, Nancy developed 
                                a passion for art at the early age of three.
                                During her formative years, she explored
                                various media, including watercolor, oil
                                pastels, ink, and colored pencils, laying the
                                foundation for her artistic journey.</p>

                            Determined to refine her techniques, Nancy pursued a Fine Arts 
                            degree, majoring in Painting, while also exploring Interior Design. 
                            However, her true calling remained in painting, leading her to fully 
                            embrace it as she nears the completion of her studies.

                                Throughout her college years, Nancy 
                                actively contributed to the art community 
                                by conducting summer workshops for
                                children and working as a part-time 
                                illustrator for children's books. 
                                Her dedication to her craft has also driven her 
                                to participate in prestigious art 
                                competitions such as the Shell National Art

                             Nancyâ€™s paintings celebrate a wide 
                            range of media, including acrylics, 
                            textured surfaces, metallic sheets, 
                            and resin. Her work explores the 
                            balance of vibrancy and tranquility,
                            with techniques such as layering, 
                            sculpting, and carving to create
                            depth and texture. Drawing deep 
                            inspiration from nature, her art 
                            delves into the interconnectedness 
                            of all things, weaving together 
                            contemporary art and the natural
